# Install The Snowflake-Connected Edition

Run `backend/dist/Snowflake_Intelligence_Workspace_Setup.sql` unchanged with an
approved warehouse and source database selected. Initial installation, app hosting
and AI are enabled. The final result includes `STATUS`, `OPEN_APP_URL` and
`NEXT_ACTION`. The existing UI opens with explicitly synthetic retail data.

An account administrator must already have approved a container compute pool and
package-download integration. An empty pool setting selects the account default;
an empty integration setting selects only a unique enabled integration with PYPI
or PACKAGE in its name. Ambiguous or unavailable prerequisites are reported, not
invented. The installer uses isolated roles and its owned database. It does not
resize shared compute or install scheduled refreshes. Warehouse, container,
storage and AI use incur charges.

## Store Manager View

The profile menu also offers a store manager for one Harbor Retail store, chosen
from the brand's six physical stores (Atlanta Central by default). It shows that
store's week: twelve signals from `DATA.STORE_SIGNALS` against the brand's other
stores, its agents grouped by availability, sell-through, sales against peers,
customer voice, loss prevention and its shopping center, and today's decisions
built from those signals. Decisions and notes are recorded in the viewer's
workspace; nothing is sent.

**Floor** opens a store builder on a researched sample layout, not the store's own
floor, stocked with that store's sizes from Snowflake as of September 13, 2026.
Changes are scored against the sample and saved in the workspace; the Sales, Shrink
and Effort scores are modelled. **Center** compares the store with the other brands'
stores in its shopping center, in percentages and points only. The thirteen shopping
centers are fictional, defined for this demo, and every sales figure is synthetic.

Store questions go to a separate store agent, `STORE_AGENT_HARBOR`, over two
semantic views. Other brands' dollar figures and mall foot traffic are not in the
data, and the agent says so. The store manager is available only with the synthetic
demo data; customer data mode does not offer it.

## Connect Customer Data

Open the globe control, **Source discovery**, in the existing workspace.
Choose a source database, then **Discover sources**. Discovery uses the viewer's
restricted caller connection, inventories up to 12 visible relations and 32
columns per relation, and requests up to three AI mapping proposals. This is
bounded metadata discovery, not an exhaustive autonomous search.

Review or edit the source, native date column, optional grouping dimension,
numeric measure, aggregation and unit. **Preview mapping** reads aggregates for
the last 14 source days. **Activate customer data** replaces the demo canvas with
the actual query-result chart without changing the app layout. Source row count
means rows, not orders, patients, customers or any other inferred entity.

Customer mode supports one source and one reviewed metric at a time. Questions
can request its trend, grouping breakdown or total over 1-90 source days. AI
selects only a bounded operation; the application executes fixed, parameterized
SQL, never model-written SQL. Units remain in source units, with no inferred
currency conversion. No joins, forecasts, inferred ratios, retail relabeling or
synthetic fallback are performed. NULL is unknown; missing dates are not padded
with fabricated zeros. More than 200 grouped results is a visible refusal.

**Return to synthetic** restores the original saved demo work. Customer evidence
and layouts are session-local and isolated by mapping and caller-role fingerprint;
they are not written into owner-readable demo state tables. Reopening the app or
activating again starts a fresh customer canvas and rechecks source access. There
is no persistent customer-data dashboard adapter in this release. Synthetic agents,
simulated monitoring, shared reviews and messaging are disabled in customer mode.

## Caller Access

Container runtime and Streamlit 1.53.1 or newer are required; this installer pins
1.63.0. Caller connections are established at startup. Caller mode uses the
viewer's default Snowflake role, not necessarily the selected Snowsight role.
The authenticated viewer must match `CURRENT_USER()`.

An administrator with `MANAGE CALLER GRANTS` must allow the app owner role to use
the viewer's existing privileges on the selected source database/schema and
table or view. These grants do not give the viewer new privileges. No source
grants are applied automatically by the app. For example, with actual approved
identifiers substituted:

```sql
GRANT CALLER USAGE ON DATABASE SOURCE_DB TO ROLE WORKSPACE_EXECUTIVE_RUNTIME;
GRANT CALLER USAGE ON SCHEMA SOURCE_DB.SOURCE_SCHEMA TO ROLE WORKSPACE_EXECUTIVE_RUNTIME;
GRANT CALLER SELECT ON TABLE SOURCE_DB.SOURCE_SCHEMA.SOURCE_TABLE TO ROLE WORKSPACE_EXECUTIVE_RUNTIME;
```

Use `ON VIEW` for a view. The viewer also needs usable warehouse and AI privileges
for discovery/questions: `USE AI FUNCTION AI_COMPLETE` (or `USE AI FUNCTIONS`),
the `SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX_USER` or `AI_FUNCTIONS_USER` database role, and access to the
selected model.

Initial setup with AI enabled, and the app upgrade, attempt these caller grants
on the actual app owner role:

```sql
GRANT CALLER USE AI FUNCTION AI_COMPLETE ON ACCOUNT TO ROLE WORKSPACE_EXECUTIVE_RUNTIME;
GRANT CALLER USAGE ON DATABASE SNOWFLAKE TO ROLE WORKSPACE_EXECUTIVE_RUNTIME;
GRANT CALLER PROGRAM USAGE ON DATABASE SNOWFLAKE TO ROLE WORKSPACE_EXECUTIVE_RUNTIME;
```

`PROGRAM USAGE` permits caller-authorized execution in the system database; it is
not a grant of customer-table access. It is broader than an individual function
grant and should be reviewed as such. The application still sends only bounded
metadata/question prompts to `AI_COMPLETE` and executes fixed source queries with
restricted caller rights. No `DATA READ`, `FULL MANAGEMENT`, customer-source
owner grant, or blanket account-wide program grant is added.

The final receipt includes `CALLER_AI_STATUS`. `CONFIGURED` confirms grant setup,
not viewer/model readiness. `ADMIN_ACTION_REQUIRED` preserves the app and reports
the exact grant error so an administrator can complete it without SQL-variable
edits. Partial successful caller grants are retained for an idempotent retry.

Restricted-caller errors can name the internal `SYSTEM$MANAGED` role. Configure
the actual app owner role, not a system role. Narrow database/schema/table caller
grants to the app owner were sufficient for the hosted source-preview test.
Missing AI access leaves manual mapping available. Missing source access prevents
preview/activation. The application never substitutes an owner-rights source
query. Row-access and masking policies remain enforced by Snowflake.

AI responses use a typed structured-output contract and bounded JSON decoding.
Missing privileges produce `AI_ACCESS_REQUIRED`; model, timeout and malformed
response failures have distinct statuses. They do not become a synthetic result.

## Upgrade Existing Apps

Select the existing workspace database and run
`backend/dist/Snowflake_Intelligence_Workspace_Upgrade.sql`. This source-only
upgrade validates the ownership marker and existing container app, backs up its
live source inside the account, stages the new code, copies it into the existing
app and commits. It preserves the app object, existing grants, saved work and the
app's own `deployment.json` settings, and attempts the three caller-AI grants above.

It also adds the store manager view: the store tables, semantic views and agent,
and `store_manager` in `deployment.json`. It re-creates the four synthetic retail
views with their grants kept. That changes two stores' synthetic figures, so their
shopping centers have a stand-out: one Metro Apparel store's new sizes now sell, and
one Grove Goods store sells less in the final week. If this step fails, the source
upgrade still completes and `STORE_MANAGER_STATUS` says why.

The receipt contains the app URL, backup path, exact source rollback SQL,
`CALLER_AI_STATUS` and `STORE_MANAGER_STATUS`. Source rollback does not revoke caller
grants or remove the store objects. Open a fresh app session after upgrading.

An ordinary setup rerun still preserves the deployed app source. It is not a
substitute for this upgrade file. The standalone HTML remains an offline visual
prototype and does not connect to Snowflake.

## Validation And Removal

Local tests cover mapping/type validation, caller-identity denial, null/sparse
results, bounded query generation, dataset isolation and the existing demo
contracts. Separate hosted, distinct-user policy tests are required before
calling the customer adapter production-ready. A created Streamlit object does
not prove that it rendered or successfully queried customer data.

Hosted checks on owned test apps covered the store manager view: the Floor builder
saved a change and reopened it, the center view and store questions matched the
synthetic data, and questions about other brands' dollars or foot traffic were
refused. Setup and the upgrade each run as one statement under Snowflake's 1 MB
query-text guidance.

Call `OPS.TEARDOWN(NULL)` in the installed database to read the removal contract.
Actual teardown requires explicit confirmation and deletes that database and its
saved work. Shared compute, integrations and roles remain. Hybrid-table deletes
do not have ordinary standard-table Fail-safe/UNDROP recovery.

This is an illustrative sample, not an official Snowflake product or a certified
production application.
